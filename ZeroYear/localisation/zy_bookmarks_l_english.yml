 EVW_TITLE:0 "East v. West"
 EVW_DESC:0 "The end of the Second World War saw the rise of two globally dominant blocs looming over Europe, once a land of uncontested superpowers. Germany and Austria, laying at the heart of the crisis, watch as their lands are partitioned, some of their citizens falling behind the Iron Curtain. The United States, in an attempt to keep their regional influence, pumps billions of dollars through the Marshall Plan. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union tests the United States' will to preside over a free world aggressively, in proxy wars like Korea. Once Asia's undisputed regional power, China, is now divided into a bitter civil war between Soviet backed Communist forces in the North, and U.S. backed Kuomintang in the South. As both superpowers find themselves in a position where each can neither be isolationist, and each are jostling for power in an increasingly nuclear world, one ponders how much destruction a potential war could bring."
